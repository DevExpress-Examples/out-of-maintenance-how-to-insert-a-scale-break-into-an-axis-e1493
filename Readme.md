# How to insert a scale break into an axis


<p>This example demonstrates how both automatic and manual <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument6232.htm">scale breaks</a> can be created within an <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument6016.htm">axis</a>, and customized at runtime.</p><p>Note that both auto-created and manual scale breaks on an axis can co-exist, without affecting the chart's output, in cases where their ranges interfere.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E1621">How to enable automatic scale breaks for an axis</a>.</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Use check boxes, to enable either auto, or manual scale breaks, or both. Note that scale breaks are calculated, to allow the ranges of manual and auto scale breaks to overlap.</p>
